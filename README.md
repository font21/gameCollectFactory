# gameCollectFactory

## README
This program is a factory for any game that needs a few clicks every few minutes within an area.
It also accepts an area to randomly click in (called a hit box) so that it appears to be human.

# Next Up:
Build in a flat database that accepts JSON data from a file to define the hitbox.
